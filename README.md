# sleepy-board-v1
The Sleepy Board can be used to capture temperature, humidity, sound (loudness) and ambient light (brightness) data. Data is read from sensors connected to a microcontroller, which is then transmitted to a database over wifi. I live right next to a main road and wanted to know what my room looks like once I have fallen asleep.
